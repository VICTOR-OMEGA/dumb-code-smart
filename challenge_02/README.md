# Challenge 02: Special Prime Pairs

---

## Problem Statement

Given a number `n`, find all unique pairs `[a, b]` such that:

- `a + b == n`
- `a < b`
- both `a` and `b` are **prime numbers**

The goal is to return a **sorted list** of these prime pairs.

## Example

### Input:
18


### Output:
[[5, 13], [7, 11]]

### Explanation:
- 5 + 13 = 18 → both prime  
- 7 + 11 = 18 → both prime  
- Only unique pairs where a < b are included

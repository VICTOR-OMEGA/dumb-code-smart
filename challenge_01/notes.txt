Algorithm Description

1. For each string:
	convert to lowercase
	use frozenset to extract its set of unique characters
	use the set as a dictionary key for grouping similar strings

2. Count how many strings share each character set

3. For each group with n >= 2 strings, count valid index pairs:
	pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2

4. Return the total count of the pairs.
